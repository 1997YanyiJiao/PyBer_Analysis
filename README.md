# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of Pyber Analysis
We create a summary DataFrame of the PyBer users based on different types of cities (urban, suburban, and rural). And using Pandas and Matplotlib, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for different city type, and with the multiple-line graph we created we can further address disparities between the three different city types.

### Total Rides, Total Drivers and Total Fares by City Type
Urban cities make up about 69% of the total rides and Rural cities account for only 5% of the total rides. 

The number of drivers in the rural areas makes up for 3% of the total drivers, and the Urban area has the mostt drivers out all three of the city types, urban cities have 81% of the total drivers. And Suburban has more than Rural but less than urban number of drivers.

Comparing the total fares to the total rides by city type, shows a consistent percentage. About 30% of the fares coming from suburban cities which is close to the 26% of the total rides in suburban cities.

### Average Fare per Ride and per Driver 
In rural areas, the average fare is about $10.00 higher than in urban areas. This difference may be due to the miles driven in rural areas versus urban areas. The suburban average fare is inbetween the rural and urban fares. 

With urban areas claiming 81% of the total drivers, the average fare per driver is the smallest at $16.57. The rural average fare per driver is the highest at $55.49, but there are significantly fewer drivers in the rural areas.

## Summary 

The Urban cities fare is the highest and consistent, we should increasing the number of drivers in the urban area.

The Rural cities fare is lower than both Urban and Suburban city types,but the average fare per driver is highest due to the small number of drivers around
